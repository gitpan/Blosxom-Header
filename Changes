  - Added DIAGNOSTICS to POD

0.05001 Jun 13th, 2012
  - Added Blosxom::Header::Proxy
  - Added _tied() method which returns Blosxom::Header::Proxy object
  - Removed _normalize_field_name()
  - status() carps if a given status code is unknown to HTTP::Status

0.04003 May 25th, 2012
  - status() receives the status code:
      $header->status(304)
    Don't pass a string which contains reason phrases:
      $header->status('304 Not Modified') # OBSOLETE
    status() returns the status code:
      $status = $header->status # 304
  - Requires HTTP::Status
  - A tied hash became read-only by default. When you need to modify it,
    you must pass an additional argument 'rw' to TIEHASH() explicitly:
      tie %header => 'Blosxom::Header', 'rw';

0.04002 May 21th, 2012
  - _normalize_field_name() became a class method internal
  - cookie() and p3p() receive LIST

  - push() is deprecated and will be removed in 0.04.
    Use push_cookie() or push_p3p() instead.
    Internally, push() was renamed to _push().
  - When we specify field names, we follow HTTP::Headers' way:
      "To make the life easier for perl users who wants to avoid quoting
      before the => operator, you can use '_' as a replacement for '-'
      in header names."
  - Added the following accessors:
      * attachment
      * charset
      * cookie
      * expires
      * nph
      * p3p
      * target
      * type

  - push() carps like CORE::push, and also receives multiple values:
      $header->push( 'Set-Cookie' => @cookies )
  - set() receives the list of named arguments:
      $header->set(
        Foo => 'bar',
        Bar => 'baz',
      )
    Separated internal '_set' method from 'set'
  - 'delete' method receives the list of field names:
        $header->delete( 'Foo', 'Bar' )
